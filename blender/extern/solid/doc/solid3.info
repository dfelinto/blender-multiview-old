Introduction
************

   SOLID is a software library containing functions for performing
intersection tests and proximity queries that are useful in the context
of collision detection. Collision detection is the process of detecting
pairs of geometric objects that are intersecting or are within a given
proximity of each other. In particular, SOLID is useful for detecting
collisions between objects that are moving relatively of each other over
time. The motions of objects are controlled by the client application,
and are not determined or affected by SOLID.

   Furthermore, SOLID provides functionality for determining geometric
data pertaining to a pair of objects that is used by the client
application for computing the appropriate response to a collision. This
data, referred to as response data, is passed to the client application
by means of a callback mechanism or by direct queries from the client
application.

Overview
========

   SOLID's functionality is subdivided into the following categories:

  1. Shape definition

  2. Object placement and motion

  3. Scene management

  4. Response definition

  5. Global actions

  6. Broad phase


Shape Definition
----------------

   The shape of a geometric object is defined relative to its local
coordinate system. A shape can be a simple geometric primitive, e.g., a
sphere or a line segment, or a complex shape composed of multiple
primitives. Shapes defined in terms of vertex positions, e.g., a
triangle mesh, may use vertex data that is stored in memory maintained
by the client application.

Object Placement and Motion
---------------------------

   A geometric object is defined by a shape, an affine transformation,
and a margin. The shape is placed in the world coordinate system by
specifying the object's local coordinate system represented by an affine
transformation.  The actual object is the set of points in world
coordinates whose distance to the shape  is at most the margin. Motion
of an object can be defined by changing the placement of the local
coordinate system, the margin, or the positions of the vertices of the
shape.

Scene Management
----------------

   Collections of objects on which collision detection has to be
performed are placed in a scene. SOLID is capable of maintaining
multiple scenes. Objects can be shared by multiple scenes. A scene
maintains cached data pertaining to the objects in the scene in order
to speed-up consecutive collision queries that are performed on the
scene.

Response Definition
-------------------

   In SOLID, collision response is handled by callback functions.  The
types of response and the callback functions that needs to be executed
for each pair of intersecting objects is stored in a response table.
Currently, there are three types of response:
  1. Simple response: no response data is returned.

  2. Witnessed response: a common point of the intersecting objects is
     returned.

  3. Depth response: the penetration depth of the intersecting objects
     is returned. The penetration depth is the shortest vector over
     which one of the objects needs to be translated in order to bring
     the objects into touching contact.

        Response tables can be shared by multiple scenes, and per scene
multiple response tables can be used. To each object that is considered
for collision detection in a response table, a response class is
assigned. Responses can be defined per pair of response classes, on all
pairs containing a specific response class, or as a default for all
pairs of response classes.  On a pair of response classes multiple
responses can be defined.  During the lifetime of an object, it is
possible to reassign the response class associated with the object per
response table.

Global Actions
--------------

   The main functionality of SOLID is to perform collision tests. Given
a scene and a response table, a collision test computes for all pairs of
colliding objects on which a response is defined the required response
data and passes these data together with the colliding pair to the
callback. The response actions are defined by the client application in
the callback and fall outside the scope of SOLID.

   The client application may also obtain response data for a given
object or pair of objects by direct queries. These direct queries are
useful for static interference checks or for tracking the closest
points of a pair of objects.

Broad Phase
-----------

   The broad phase detects changes in the overlap status of pairs of
axis-aligned boxes. The overlap status of a pair of boxes changes
whenever the boxes start or cease to overlap. The boxes are organized in
scenes similar to the scenes for objects. For each pair of boxes in a
scene whose overlap status is changed a callback is called. The client
defines a callback for pairs that start to overlap and one for pairs
that cease to overlap. The broad phase is actually a sub-layer of the
SOLID library, however the API can be directly accessed by the client
application.

Software Package
================

   Currently, the SOLID package consists of three separate layers:
  1. MT: The Mathematics Toolkit. This is a set of C++ classes
     containing abstract data types for scalars, vectors, points,
     quaternions, matrices, coordinate systems, and bounding boxes.
     Global names in this layer are prefixed with "MT_".

  2. The broad phase: A set of C++ classes wrapped by a C API. The broad
     phase detects changes in the overlap status of pairs of
     axis-aligned boxes (pairs of boxes that start or cease to
     overlap). Global names in this layer are prefixed with "BP_".

  3. The narrow phase: A set of C++ classes wrapped by a C API. The
     narrow phase performs exact collision tests for pairs of objects,
     and computes response data for the colliding pairs of objects.
     Global names in this layer are prefixed with "DT_".


New Features of SOLID version 3
===============================

   Since the previous version 2.0 of SOLID, which was released in June
1998 under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License by the
Department of Mathematics & Computing Science of Eindhoven University of
Technology, SOLID has evolved and matured considerably. New features as
well as improvements for robustness and performance have been added.
The most important changes in SOLID 3 are:
   * Use of single-precision floating-point numbers. The use of a
     32-bit floating-point format is a requirement for games and other
     interactive applications that run on current PC graphics hardware
     and consoles.

   * Penetration depth computation as a new response type. The
     penetration depth of a pair of intersecting objects is the shortest
     vector over which one of the objects needs to be translated in
     order to bring the objects in touching contact. The penetration
     depth can be used as an approximation of the contact point and
     contact plane, which are necessary for physics-based simulation.
     The depth response replaces the smart response in SOLID 2.0. Smart
     response uses the configuration of the previous time frame for
     finding the contact points and plane, which could give bad results
     when objects were interpenetrating over a number of frames.

   * SOLID 3 maintains multiple scenes. This feature is useful when
     collision detection is required for multiple tasks. For instance,
     it is possible to maintain at the same time a sound scene, a scene
     used for visibility culling, and a scene for physics simulations,
     without the objects in different scenes interfering with each
     other.

   * Stridden vertex arrays can be used for defining complex shapes.

   * Objects can be expanded spherically, i.e., a margin that defines
     the radius of the sphere that is 'added' can be set for each
     object. The object is the set of points whose distance to the
     shape is at most the margin. Margins are useful for creating
     objects with rounded edges, or 'sensitive' areas around an object.

   * Functions for direct computation of response data have been added
     to the API. This is useful, since it allows the client to check
     overlap status, distance, etc., without having to perform a global
     collision test.

   * A ray cast has been added to SOLID. The ray cast returns the
     object in a scene that the ray hits first. Also, the hit spot and
     surface normal to this object are returned.

   * Response callbacks are defined in a response table independent of
     a scene.

   * Response callbacks are defined per pair of response classes rather
     than per object pair. With each object for which a response is
     defined in a response table, a response class is associated. The
     response class of an object may change over time.

   * It is now possible to define multiple response callbacks per
     object pair.  This is useful for performing several actions for a
     single collision (play sound, apply impulse, update statistics).

Installing the SOLID SDK
************************

Requirements
============

   The SOLID library (libsolid) and the broad-phase library (libbroad)
have a standard C API and can be linked to both C and C++ applications.
Note that libsolid and libbroad are internally coded in C++ and thus
need the libstdc++ library on Unix platforms (link using g++ rather
than gcc).  The mathematics toolkit (MT) is coded in standard C++ and
uses templates extensively. The source code compiles under GNU g++
version 2.95 and higher and Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 SP4 and
higher.

Installation
============

   All header files that export types and functions are stored in the
`include' directory.  Source files are stored in the `src' directory.
On a Unix-like operating system, a `configure' script generated by the
GNU build tools (automake, autoconf, libtool) is used for creating the
Makefiles.  Simply type `./configure' followed by `make' in the root of
the SOLID distribution directory to build the SOLID lib and example
programs.  Typing `make install' installs the SOLID library header
files and binaries as well as this documentation in `/usr/local'.  Note
that you usually must have root privileges for adding items to
`/usr/local'.  See `./configure --help' for installing the library in a
different location.

   The SOLID library can be built under Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and
higher using the workspace (.dsw) and project (.dsp) files found in the
`VisualC6' directory.  For use with Visual C++ 7.0 and higher, the
workspace and project files must first be converted to the newer
solution (.sln) and project (.vcproj) formats.  On a Win32 platform,
the simplest way to make the SOLID SDK accessible in your applications
is to add the SOLID `include' and `lib' directories to respectively the
include and link path used by the compiler.  For running executables
built using SOLID, the `solid.dll' should be contained in the
executable search path.  This is achieved most easily by copying these
DLLs either to the directory containing the executable or to the
`WINxxxx/system32' directory.

   SOLID uses the Qhull library for computing convex hulls of sets of
points.  In case the Qhull library is not available for your platform,
SOLID can still be built. However, in that case, queries on convex
hulls built with `DT_NewPolytope' (see below) fall back to brute force
algorithms, and are therefore much slower.  In order to build a SOLID
library without Qhull, make sure that the preprocessing flag `-DQHULL'
is not set.

   The core of SOLID may use either single or double precision
floating-point arithmetic.  The default option is single-precision.  In
order to build a double-precision SOLID core, use `configure' with the
`--enable-doubles' option.  Under Visual C++, doubles can be enabled
using the `-DUSE_DOUBLES' preprocessing flag.  Note that this flag only
affects the floating-point numbers that are used internally in SOLID.
The API functions always use single-precision floating-point numbers.

   In the same way, the SOLID core can be built using a tracer class for
scalars.  See the file `MT_ScalarTracer.h' in the `include' directory.
A scalar tracer is used for tracing rounding errors in results of
floating-point operations.  An object of the type `MT_ScalarTracer' has
a value field and an error field. The value field holds the result of
an operation, and the error field multiplied by the machine epsilon
gives an estimated upper bound for the relative rounding error.  The
`MT_ScalarTracer' class behaves as the primitive scalar types `float'
and `double', however, constants of this type have to be constructed
explicitly.  In order to build a SOLID core that uses scalar tracers,
create Makefiles using `configure' with the `--enable-tracer' option.
Under Visual C++, the tracers are enabled using the `-DUSE_TRACER'
preprocessing flag.  This option is very useful for debugging purposes.
Makefiles for building debug binaries of SOLILD are created using the
`--enable-debug' option.

The SOLID API
*************

   The SOLID API is a set of C functions. All API functions, also
referred to as commands, use arguments that have primitive types, such
as, integers, floats, and arrays of floats, or handles (type-mangled
pointers) to internal objects of SOLID. The types `DT_Scalar',
`DT_Vector' and `DT_Quaternion' are simply typedefs:

     typedef float     DT_Scalar;
     typedef DT_Scalar DT_Vector3[3];
     typedef DT_Scalar DT_Quaternion[4];
   The MT C++ classes can be used for representing geometric data such
as vectors and quaternions as they are implicitly casted to arrays of
floats, however the use of these classes is not required for calling
SOLID functions.  SOLID API functions can be called using your own or
third-party 3D geometry objects if you stick with the following rules:
   * All used scalar types are of the type `float'.

   * Quaternions store their imaginary vector part before the real
     scalar part. Thus, for an array `float q[4]' that represents a
     quaternion, `q[3]' must be the scalar part.

   * Transformations are specified using arrays of 16 floating-point
     numbers representing a 4x4 column-major matrix as used in OpenGL.
     This matrix representation is discussed below.


Building Shapes
===============

   The commands for creating and destroying shapes are

     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewBox(DT_Scalar x, DT_Scalar y, DT_Scalar z);
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewCone(DT_Scalar radius, DT_Scalar height);
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewCylinder(DT_Scalar radius, DT_Scalar height);
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewSphere(DT_Scalar radius);
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewPoint(const DT_Vector3 point);
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewLineSegment(const DT_Vector3 source,
                                      const DT_Vector3 target);
     
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewMinkowski(DT_ShapeHandle shape1,
                                    DT_ShapeHandle shape2);
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewHull(DT_ShapeHandle shape1,
                               DT_ShapeHandle shape2);
     
     void           DT_DeleteShape(DT_ShapeHandle shape);
   Shapes are referred to by values of `DT_ShapeHandle'.  The command
`DT_NewBox' creates a rectangular parallelepiped centered at the origin
and aligned with the axes of the shape's local coordinate system.  The
parameters specify its extent along the respective coordinate axes.
The commands `DT_NewCone' and `DT_NewCylinder' create respectively a
cone and a cylinder centered at the origin and whose central axis is
aligned with the y-axis of the local coordinate system.  The cone's
apex is at y = height / 2.  The command `DT_NewSphere' creates a sphere
centered at the origin of the local coordinate system.  The command
`DT_NewPoint' creates a single point.  The command `DT_NewLineSegment'
creates a single line segment in a similar way.

   Any pair of convex shapes (including general polytopes) can be
combined to form compound shapes using the commands `DT_NewMinkowski'
and `DT_NewHull'.  The command `DT_NewMinkowski' `adds' the two shapes
by sweeping one shape along the other. For instance, the Minkowski
addition of a sphere and a line segment creates a hot dog.  The command
`DT_NewHull' creates a shape that represents the exact convex hull of
the two shapes.

   Complex shape types composed of simple polytopes (polytope soups) are
created using the `DT_NewComplexShape' command.  Here, a simple
polytope is a d-dimensional polytopes, where d is at most 3.  A simple
d-polytope can be a simplex (point, line segment, triangle,
tetrahedron), a convex polygon, or a convex polyhedron.

   There are no topological constraints on the set of vertices of a
polytope.  In particular, the vertices of a polytope need not be
affinely independent, and need not be extreme vertices of the convex
hull.  However, convex polytopes with many vertices may deteriorate the
performance.  Such complex polytopes should be created using the
`DT_NewPolytope' command.  Make sure that in that case, SOLID is built
using Qhull.

   For constructing complex shapes the following commands are used:
     DT_VertexBaseHandle DT_NewVertexBase(const void *pointer,
                                          DT_Size stride);
     void DT_DeleteVertexBase(DT_VertexBaseHandle vertexBase);
     void DT_ChangeVertexBase(DT_VertexBaseHandle vertexBase,
                              const void *pointer);
     
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewComplexShape(DT_VertexBaseHandle vertexBase);
     void           DT_EndComplexShape();
     
     DT_ShapeHandle DT_NewPolytope(DT_VertexBaseHandle vertexBase);
     void           DT_EndPolytope();
     
     void DT_Begin();
     void DT_End();
     
     void DT_Vertex(const DT_Vector3 vertex);
     void DT_VertexIndex(DT_Index index);
     
     void DT_VertexIndices(DT_Count count, const DT_Index *indices);
     void DT_VertexRange(DT_Index first, DT_Count count);
   A d-polytope is specified by enumerating its vertices. This can be
done in two ways. In the first way, the vertices are specified by value,
using the `DT_Vertex' command. The following example shows how the
faces of a pyramid are specified.

     DT_Vector3 float verts[] = {
     		   {  1.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f },
     		   {  1.0f,  0.0f, -1.0f },
     		   { -1.0f,  0.0f, -1.0f },
     		   { -1.0f,  0.0f,  1.0f },
     		   {  0.0f, 1.27f,  0.0f }
     };
     
     DT_ShapeHandle pyramid = DT_NewComplexShape(NULL);
     
     DT_Begin();
     DT_Vertex(verts[0]);
     DT_Vertex(verts[1]);
     DT_Vertex(verts[2]);
     DT_Vertex(verts[3]);
     DT_End();
     
     DT_Begin();
     DT_Vertex(verts[0]);
     DT_Vertex(verts[1]);
     DT_Vertex(verts[4]);
     DT_End();
     
     ...
     
     DT_EndComplexShape();
   Here, an argument of `NULL' in `DT_NewComplexShape' denotes that the
complex shape does not use an external vertex array.

   In the second method, the vertices are referred to by indices.  For
each complex shape, we specify a single array of vertices.  Vertex
arrays are maintained by the client application and can be accessed
directly by SOLID.  Vertex arrays are accessed via vertex bases.  De
command `DT_NewVertexBase' creates a vertex base for the array given by
the argument `pointer'.  The client must maintain vertex data in
single-precision floating-point format.  The client is free to store
vertex data using arbitrary spacing in-between the individual array
items.  The spacing is specified using the `DT_Size stride' parameter.
For instance, the client maintains an array of vertices of the type:

     struct Vertex {
         float xyz[3];
         float uv[2];
         float normal[3];
     };
     
     struct Vertex verts[NUM_VERTICES];
   When specifying a complex shape you can use this data as follows

     DT_VertexBaseHandle base = DT_NewVertexBase(verts[0].xyz,
                                                 sizeof(struct Vertex));
   A stride of zero denotes that the vertex coordinate data is packed
in a separate array, thus

     DT_Vector3 verts[NUM_VERTICES];
     
     DT_VertexBaseHandle base = DT_NewVertexBase(verts[0], 0);
   Each time the vertices are updated, or a new vertex base is assigned,
to a complex shape, for instance, when using a deformable triangle mesh,
the client needs to notify SOLID of a changed vertex array by calling
`DT_ChangeVertexBase'.  We discuss the use of this command further on.

   The handle to the vertex base is passed as argument to
`DT_NewComplexShape'.  The command `DT_VertexIndex' is used for
specifying vertices. See the following example:

     DT_ShapeHandle pyramid = DT_NewComplexShape(base);
     
     DT_Begin();
     DT_VertexIndex(0);
     DT_VertexIndex(1);
     DT_VertexIndex(2);
     DT_VertexIndex(3);
     DT_End();
     
     DT_Begin();
     DT_VertexIndex(0);
     DT_VertexIndex(1);
     DT_VertexIndex(4);
     DT_End();
     
     ...
     
     DT_EndComplexShape();
   Alternatively, the indices can be placed into an array and specified
using the command `DT_VertexIndices', as in the following example:

     DT_Index face0[4] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
     DT_Index face1[3] = { 0, 1, 4 };
     
     ...
     
     DT_VertexIndices(4, face0);
     DT_VertexIndices(3, face1);
   Finally, a polytope can be specified from a range of vertices using
the command `DT_VertexRange'.  The range is specified by the first
index and the number of vertices.  In the following example a pyramid
is constructed as a convex polyhedron, which is the convex hull of the
vertices in the array.

     DT_ShapeHandle pyramid = DT_NewComplexShape(base);
     DT_VertexRange(0, 5);
     DT_EndComplexShape();
   The same shape can be built using the `DT_NewPolytope' command:

     DT_ShapeHandle pyramid = DT_NewPolytope(base);
     DT_VertexRange(0, 5);
     DT_EndPolytope();
   Note that within a `DT_NewPolytope' construction all the vertex array
commands can be used to specify vertices.  The commands `DT_Begin' and
`DT_End' are ignored for polytopes.  Convex polytopes constructed using
the `DT_NewPolytope' command are preprocessed by SOLID in order to
allow for faster testing, and should be used when the number of
vertices is large.

Creating and Moving Objects
===========================

   An object is an instance of a shape.  The commands for creating,
moving and deleting objects are

     DT_ObjectHandle DT_CreateObject(void *client_object, DT_ShapeHandle shape);
     void            DT_DestroyObject(DT_ObjectHandle object);
     
     void DT_SetPosition(DT_ObjectHandle object, const DT_Vector3 position);
     void DT_SetOrientation(DT_ObjectHandle object,
                            const DT_Quaternion orientation);
     void DT_SetScaling(DT_ObjectHandle object, const DT_Vector3 scaling);
     
     void DT_SetMatrixf(DT_ObjectHandle object, const float *m);
     void DT_SetMatrixd(DT_ObjectHandle object, const double *m);
     
     void DT_SetMargin(DT_ObjectHandle object, DT_Scalar margin);
   An object is referred to by a `DT_ObjectHandle'.  The first
parameter `void *client_object' is a pointer to an arbitrary structure
in the client application.  This pointer is passed as parameter to the
callback function in case of a collision, and can be used for collision
handling.  In general, a pointer to a structure in the client
application associated with the collision object should be used.

   An object's motion is specified by changing the placement of the
local coordinate system of the shape.  Initially, the local coordinate
system of an object coincides with the world coordinate system.

   The placement of an object is changed, either by setting the
position, orientation, and scaling, or by using an OpenGL 4x4
column-major matrix representing an affine transformation.  Placements
are specified relative to the world coordinate system.  Rotations are
specified using quaternions.  The object's local coordinate system can
be scaled non-uniformly by specifying a scale factor per coordinate
axis.  Following example shows how a pair of objects are given absolute
placements.

     DT_ObjectHandle objectHandle = DT_CreateObject(&myObject, shapeHandle);
     
     float position = { 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f };
     float orientation = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.1f };
     float scaling = { 1.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f };
     
     DT_SetPosition(objectHandle, position);
     DT_SetOrientation(objectHandle, orientation);
     DT_SetScaling(objectHandle, scaling);
   For scalings along axes that are not coordinate axes, such as shears,
you should construct a 4x4 column-major matrix representation of the
local coordinate system and use `DT_SetMatrix' to specify the object
placement.

   The x-axis of the local coordinate system relative to the world
coordinate system is the vector (m[0], m[1], m[2]), the y-axis is
(m[4], m[5], m[6]), the z-axis is (m[8], m[9], m[10]), and the local
origin is (m[12], m[13], m[14]).  The elements m[3], m[7], m[11], and
m[15] are ignored.  These values are assumed to be 0, 0, 0, and 1,
respectively.  Thus, only affine transformations are allowed.

   By setting a positive margin using `DT_SetMargin' you can
spherically expand an object. The actual collision object is the set of
points whose distance to the transformed shape is at most the margin.
For instance, a hot dog or capsule can be created using

     DT_Vector3 source = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f }
     DT_Vector3 target = { 0.0f, -1.5f, 0.0f }
     
     DT_ShapeHandle line = DT_NewLineSegment(source, target);
     
     DT_ObjectHandle object = DT_CreateObject(&myHotDog, line);
     DT_SetMargin(object, 0.3f);
   This object is useful for navigating along walls and over terrains
Positions, orientations, scalings, and margins may all be changed
during the life time of an object.

Who's Afraid of Quaternions?
----------------------------

   A quaternion is a four-dimensional vector. The set of quaternions of
length one (points on a four-dimensional sphere) map to the set of
orientations in three-dimensional space. Since in many applications an
orientation defined by either a rotation axis and angle or by a triple
of Euler angles is more convenient, the package includes code for
quaternion operations. The code is found in the mathematics toolkit
(MT).

   The quaternion class is located in the file `MT_Quaternion.h'. The
class has constructors and methods for setting a quaternion. For example

     MT_Quaternion q1(axis, angle);
     MT_Quaternion q2(yaw, pitch, roll);
     
     ...
     
     q1.setRotation(axis, angle);
     q2.setEuler(yaw, pitch, roll);
     
     ...
     
     DT_SetOrientation(objectHandle, q1);
   Also included is a static method `MT_Quaternion::random()', which
returns a random orientation.

Proximity Queries
-----------------

   Objects can also be queried directly using the commands

     DT_Scalar DT_GetClosestPair(DT_ObjectHandle object1, DT_ObjectHandle object2,
                                 DT_Vector3 point1, DT_Vector3 point2);
     
     DT_Bool   DT_GetCommonPoint(DT_ObjectHandle object1, DT_ObjectHandle object2,
                                 DT_Vector3 point);
     
     DT_Bool   DT_GetPenDepth(DT_ObjectHandle object1, DT_ObjectHandle object2,
                              DT_Vector3 point1, DT_Vector3 point2);
   The command `DT_GetClosestPair' returns the distance between
`object1' and `object2', and a pair of closest points `point1' and
`point2' given in world coordinates The command `DT_GetCommonPoint'
returns a boolean that denotes whether the objects `object1' and
`object2' intersect, and, in case of an intersection, returns a common
point `point' in world coordinates.  The command `DT_GetPenDepth' also
returns a boolean that denotes whether the objects `object1' and
`object2' intersect, and, in case of an intersection, returns a pair of
witness points of the penetration depth `point1' and `point2' in world
coordinates.

   The maximum relative error in the closest points and penetration
depth computation can be set using

     void DT_SetAccuracy(DT_Scalar max_error);
   The default for `max_error' is 1.0e-3. Larger errors result in
better performance. Non-positive error tolerances are ignored.

   The maximum tolerance on relative errors due to rounding is set using

     void DT_SetTolerance(DT_Scalar tol_error);
   This value is the estimated relative rounding error in complex
computations and is used for determining whether a floating-point
number should be regarded as zero or not. The default value for
`tol_error' is the machine epsilon, which is `FLT_EPSILON' when floats
are used, and `DBL_EPSILON' when double-precision floating-point
numbers are used internally. Very large tolerances result in false
collisions. Setting tol_error too small results in missed collisions.
Non-positive error tolerances are ignored.

   Furthermore, objects can be queried to return data maintained
internally.  The world-axes aligned bounding box of an object is
returned using

     void DT_GetBBox(DT_ObjectHandle object, DT_Vector3 min, DT_Vector3 max);
   Here, `min' and `max' are the vertices of the box with respectively
the least and greatest world coordinates.  The local-to-world
transformation of an object can be returned using

     void DT_GetMatrixf(DT_ObjectHandle object, float *m);
     void DT_GetMatrixd(DT_ObjectHandle object, double *m);
   The arguments of these commands are again arrays of 16
floating-point numbers that represent a 4x4 column-major matrix as
discussed above.

Scenes
======

   For scenes with many objects the number of pairwise intersection
queries can become quite large.  To overcome this bottleneck, objects
are maintained in scenes.  The commands for construction and destroying
scenes are:

     DT_SceneHandle DT_CreateScene();
     void           DT_DestroyScene(DT_SceneHandle scene);
     void           DT_AddObject(DT_SceneHandle scene,
                                 DT_ObjectHandle object);
     void           DT_RemoveObject(DT_SceneHandle scene,
                                    DT_ObjectHandle object);
   Objects can be shared by multiple scenes.  Each scene tracks the
changes of placement and deformations of its objects, and updates its
cached data accordingly. In this way, global collision queries using
`DT_Test' (see below) can be processed much faster.

Response Handling
=================

   Collision response in SOLID is handled by means of callback
functions.  The callback functions have the type `DT_ResponseCallback'
defined by

     typedef DT_Bool (*DT_ResponseCallback)(void *client_data,
                                            void *client_object1,
                                            void *client_object2,
                                            const DT_CollData *coll_data);
   Here, `client_data' is a pointer to an arbitrary structure in the
client application, `client_object1' and `client_object2' are the
pointers to structures in the client application specified in
`DT_CreateObject', and `coll_data' is the response data computed by
SOLID.  The Boolean value returned by a callback functions indicates
whether further processing of callbacks is needed.  If `DT_FALSE' or
`DT_CONTINUE' is returned, then the remaining colliding object pairs
are processed.  If `DT_TRUE' or `DT_DONE' is returned, then the call to
`DT_Test' is exited without further processing.  We discuss the
`DT_Test' further on.

   Currently, there are three types of response: "simple", "depth" and
"witnessed" response. For simple response the value of `coll_data' is
`NULL'.  For depth and witnessed response `coll_data' points to the
following structure


     typedef struct DT_CollData {
         DT_Vector3 point1;
         DT_Vector3 point2;
         DT_Vector3 normal;
     } DT_CollData;
   An object of this type represents a pair of points of the respective
objects. The points  `point1' and `point2' are given relative to the
world coordinate system. The `normal' field is used for depth response
only.

   For witnessed response, the points represent a witness of the
collision.  Both points are contained in the intersection of the
colliding objects.  Note that the witness points are not necessarily
equal.  For depth response, the `normal' represent the penetration depth
vector.  The penetration depth vector is the shortest vector over which
one object needs to be translated in order to bring the two objects into
touching contact.  The `point1' and `point2' fields contain the witness
points of the penetration depth, thus `normal = point2 - point1'.

   Response callbacks are managed in "response tables".  Response
tables are defined independent of the scenes in which they are used.
Multiple response tables can be used in one scene, and a response table
can be shared among scenes.  Responses are defined on (pairs of)
response classes. Each response table maintains its set of response
classes.  A response table is created and destroyed using the commands

     DT_RespTableHandle DT_CreateRespTable();
     void               DT_DestroyRespTable(DT_RespTableHandle respTable);
   A response class for a response table is generated using

     DT_ResponseClass DT_GenResponseClass(DT_RespTableHandle respTable);
   To each object for which a response is defined in the response table
a response class needs to be assigned. This is done using

     void DT_SetResponseClass(DT_RespTableHandle respTable,
                              DT_ObjectHandle object,
                              DT_ResponseClass responseClass);
   For each pair of objects multiple responses can be defined. A
response is a callback together with its response type and client data.
The `DT_ResponseType' is defined by

     typedef enum DT_ResponseType {
         DT_NO_RESPONSE,
         DT_SIMPLE_RESPONSE,
         DT_WITNESSED_RESPONSE
         DT_DEPTH_RESPONSE,
     } DT_ResponseType;
   Responses can be defined for all pairs of response classes...

     void DT_AddDefaultResponse(DT_RespTableHandle respTable,
                                DT_ResponseCallback response,
                                DT_ResponseType type,
                                void *client_data);
     
     void DT_RemoveDefaultResponse(DT_RespTableHandle respTable,
                                   DT_ResponseCallback response);
   ...per response class...

     void DT_AddClassResponse(DT_RespTableHandle respTable,
                              DT_ResponseClass responseClass,
                              DT_ResponseCallback response,
                              DT_ResponseType type,
                              void *client_data);
     
     void DT_RemoveClassResponse(DT_RespTableHandle respTable,
                                 DT_ResponseClass responseClass,
                                 DT_ResponseCallback response);
   ... and per pair of response classes...

     void DT_AddPairResponse(DT_RespTableHandle respTable,
                             DT_ResponseClass responseClass1,
                             DT_ResponseClass responseClass2,
                             DT_ResponseCallback response,
                             DT_ResponseType type,
                             void *client_data);
     
     void DT_RemovePairResponse(DT_RespTableHandle respTable,
                                DT_ResponseClass responseClass1,
                                DT_ResponseClass responseClass2,
                                DT_ResponseCallback response);
   If for an object pair, one of the objects has a class object
response defined, that needs to be overruled by a pair response, then
you should remove the callback defined in the class response for the
pair and add the pair response, thus

     DT_AddClassResponse(respTable, class1, classResponse,
                         DT_SIMPLE_RESPONSE, client_data);
     
     DT_RemovePairResponse(respTable, class1, class2, classResponse);
     
     DT_AddPairResponse(respTable, class1, class2, pairResponse,
                        DT_DEPTH_RESPONSE, client_data);
   In the same way, a default response can be overruled by a class or
pair response.

   The response callback functions are executed by calling

     DT_Count DT_Test(DT_SceneHandle scene, DT_RespTableHandle respTable);
   This command calls for each colliding pair of objects the
corresponding callback function until all pairs are processed or until
a callback function returns `DT_TRUE' or `DT_DONE'.  It returns the
number of object pairs for which callback functions have been executed.

   Note: If the response classes of the objects in a callback differ,
then `client_object1' has a `lower' response class than
`client_object2'. That is, the response class of `client_object1' is
generated before the response class of `client_object2'.

Deformable Models
=================

   SOLID handles deformations of complex shapes.  In this context
deformations are specified by changes of vertex positions.  Complex
shapes that are defined using a vertex array in the client application
may be deformed by changing the array elements, or specifying a new
array.  SOLID is notified of a change of vertices by the command

     void DT_ChangeVertexBase(DT_VertexBaseHandle vertexBase,
                              const void *pointer);
   Note that polytopes constructed from a vertex base using
`DT_NewPolytope' are not affected by a change of vertices.

Ray Cast
========

   NOTE: This feature is currently implemented for spheres, boxes,
triangles, and triangle meshes only.  Also, margins are ignored for ray
casts.

   The commands for performing ray casts are

     void *DT_RayCast(DT_SceneHandle scene, void *ignore_client,
                      const DT_Vector3 source,
                      const DT_Vector3 target,
                      DT_Scalar max_param,
                      DT_Scalar *param, DT_Vector3 normal);
     
     DT_Bool DT_ObjectRayCast(DT_ObjectHandle object,
                              const DT_Vector3 source,
                              const DT_Vector3 target,
                              DT_Scalar max_param,
                              DT_Scalar *param, DT_Vector3 normal);
   The ray is given by `source', `target', and `max_param'.  It
represents the line segment `source' + (`target' - `source') * t, where
t is a member of the interval [0, `max_param'].  So, if `max_param' is
1, then the ray is simply the line segment from `source' to `target',
whereas if `max_param' is equal to `FLT_MAX', then the ray is
`infinite'.

   `DT_RayCast' returns a pointer to the client object of an object in
`scene' that is hit first by the ray, or `NULL' if no object is hit.
`DT_ObjectRayCast' performs a ray cast on a single object and returns a
Boolean indicating a hit.  In case of a hit, `param' points to the t of
the hit spot, and `normal' is a normal to the object's surface in world
coordinates.  The normal always points towards the `source'.  An object
can be made transparent for the ray cast by specifying the object's
client object as `ignore_client'.  This is useful if you need to ignore
hits of the ray with the source object of the ray.  For instance
terrain following can be implemented by casting a ray down and setting
the moving object at a distance above the spot.  In this case, you are
probably interested in hits with the terrain only, and do not need
reports of hits with the moving object.

Bug Reports
***********

   Please send remarks, questions, and bug reports to gino@dtecta.com.

   NOTE: There is no termination after a fixed maximum number of
iterations of GJK in this version of SOLID, since I believe in an
industrial-strength GJK without resorting to tolerance tweaking or
forced termination after a certain number of iterations. I welcome any
reports of SOLID misbehaving.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and
     distribute this license document.

   The intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and
change the software regulated by this license under the open source
model.

   This license applies to any software containing a notice placed by
the copyright holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms
of the Q Public License version 1.0.  Such software is herein referred
to as the Software.  This license covers modification and distribution
of the Software, use of third-party application programs based on the
Software, and development of free software which uses the Software.

Granted Rights
==============

  1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license
     provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in
     this license.  Whole or partial distribution of the Software, or
     software items that link with the Software, in any form signifies
     acceptance of this license.

  2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form
     provided that the entire package, including - but not restricted
     to - copyright, trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by
     the initial developer of the Software, is distributed.

  3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your
     modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such
     as patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

       a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices
          in the Software.

       b. When modifications to the Software are released under this
          license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the
          initial developer of the Software to distribute your
          modification in future versions of the Software provided such
          versions remain available under these terms in addition to
          any other license(s) of the initial developer.


  4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or
     machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software,
     provided that you meet these restrictions:

       a. You must include this license document in the distribution.

       b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable
          forms are also able to receive the complete machine-readable
          source code to the distributed Software, including all
          modifications, without any charge beyond the costs of data
          transfer, and place prominent notices in the distribution
          explaining this.

       c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
          machine-executable forms are available under the terms of
          this license.


  5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
     compile, link and run application programs legally developed by
     you or by others.

  6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and
     other software items that link with the original or modified
     versions of the Software.  These items, when distributed, are
     subject to the following requirements:

       a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable
          forms of these items are also able to receive and use the
          complete machine-readable source code to the items without
          any charge beyond the costs of data transfer.

       b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to
          use and re-distribute original and modified versions of the
          items in both machine-executable and source code forms. The
          recipients must be able to do so without any charges
          whatsoever, and they must be able to re-distribute to anyone
          they choose.

       c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
          initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the
          items, then you must supply one.


Limitations of Liability
========================

   In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be
liable for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to -
lost revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental
or consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the
possibility of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if
any, provides otherwise.

No Warranty
===========

   The Software and this license document are provided AS IS with NO
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF DESIGN, MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Choice of Law
=============

   This license is governed by the Laws of Norway. Disputes shall be
settled by Oslo City Court.
